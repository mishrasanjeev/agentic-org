# Findings

Defects found while doing other work and deliberately left out of that change.
Each entry says where it was found, what is wrong and what fixing it involves.

## A-1 — Console image base has fixable HIGH advisories in libuuid

- **Found:** container scan of `Dockerfile.ui` (2026-09-14).
- **What:** the pinned `nginx:alpine@sha256:72ba65eb…` base ships util-linux
  `libuuid` 2.42.1-r0, affected by CVE-2026-53612, CVE-2026-53613,
  CVE-2026-53614, CVE-2026-76642, CVE-2026-78408, CVE-2026-78409 and
  CVE-2026-78410 (fixed in 2.42.3-r0 / 2.42.3-r1). The nightly scan only
  covered the API image, so this was not reported before.
- **Fix:** move the digest in `Dockerfile.ui` to an `nginx:alpine` build with
  libuuid 2.42.3-r1 or later (`scripts/refresh_image_digests.sh`), rebuild,
  rescan and drop the seven entries from `.trivyignore.yaml`.

## A-2 — CONTRIBUTING.md overstates the coverage gate

- **Found:** editing `CONTRIBUTING.md` (2026-09-14).
- **What:** "Tests" says a minimum 80% coverage is enforced in CI; CI and
  `scripts/preflight.sh` enforce `--cov-fail-under=55` plus per-module floors
  (`scripts/check_module_coverage.py`).
- **Fix:** state the real gate. The governed-actions work raises it to 75% on
  changed code, so update the text in that change.

## A-3 — Preflight mypy and CI lint type-check different environments

- **Found:** running `scripts/preflight.sh` on `main` at 784cbd03 (2026-09-14).
- **What:** the CI `lint` job installs only `ruff mypy pydantic` before
  `mypy --ignore-missing-imports .`, so third-party packages such as structlog
  are untyped (`Any`) there. Preflight runs the same command inside a full
  `.[dev]` environment, where structlog's types apply, and fails on
  `core/logging_config.py:92` (`list-item`) while CI passes. The script says
  it mirrors CI exactly; it does not.
- **Fix:** type-check against the installed dependencies in both places
  (install `.[dev]` in the lint job) and fix the processor list's annotation,
  or make preflight mirror the lint job's minimal environment. The first
  catches real type errors; the second only restores agreement.
