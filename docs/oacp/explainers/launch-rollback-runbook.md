# Launch And Rollback Runbook

Canonical end-to-end flow: [OACP end-user flow](../end-user-flow.md).

## Launch Smoke

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  packet[Onboarding packet] --> shopify[Shopify credentials]
  shopify --> sync[Read-only sync]
  sync --> authority[Grantex authority]
  authority --> cache[Artifact cache]
  cache --> buyer[Buyer Q&A]
  buyer --> prepare[Purchase preparation]
  prepare --> pos[Offline POS packet]
  pos --> reconcile[POS simulator or verified callback]
```

## Rollback

1. Disable buyer surfaces for the merchant.
2. Mark affected cache records stale.
3. Stop Shopify sync.
4. Remove Grantex tenant allowlist or rotate service token if needed.
5. Disable POS handoff for the merchant if callback evidence or store metadata is stale.
6. Re-enable only after smoke tests pass.

## POS Smoke

- Create a handoff packet from prepared purchase output.
- Run simulator `accepted` and verify buyer wording still requires staff/payment confirmation.
- Submit unverified `payment_confirmed` and verify it becomes staff review.
- Confirm fake packet ids return safe auth/404 responses, not server errors.
